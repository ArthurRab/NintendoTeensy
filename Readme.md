A partial rewrite of the 'Nintendo' library to support running on Teensy 4.0, and which happened to fix some bugs as well, such as one where failing reading from a controller would cause failures to write unrelated data as well.

The N64 part of this almost certainly won't work since I haven't tested it, but probably could be made to work.
